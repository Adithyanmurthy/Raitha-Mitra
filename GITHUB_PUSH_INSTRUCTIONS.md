# GitHub Push Instructions

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Deleted all .md files** except README.md
2. **Set up Git LFS** for large files:
   - Model file: `crop_disease_detection_model.h5` (tracked by LFS)
   - Demo video: `static/videos/demo.mp4` (tracked by LFS)
3. **Created .gitignore** to exclude unnecessary files
4. **Committed all files** to Git with proper message

## 📊 Repository Status

- **Branch**: main
- **Commit**: Initial commit with all project files
- **Files tracked by Git LFS**: 
  - crop_disease_detection_model.h5
  - static/videos/demo.mp4
- **Total files**: 82 files, 24,165 lines of code

## 🚀 Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Repository name: `raitha-mitra` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "AI-powered farming assistant with disease detection"
   - Make it Public or Private (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. **Copy the repository URL** (it will look like):
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/raitha-mitra.git
   ```

3. **Run these commands** in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/raitha-mitra.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Push to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Git LFS Bandwidth
- GitHub provides 1 GB of free LFS storage and 1 GB/month bandwidth
- Your model file is ~100MB and video is ~173MB
- Total LFS files: ~273MB
- This is within free tier limits

### First Push May Take Time
- The model and video files are large
- First push will upload these to LFS
- Subsequent pushes will be faster (only changes)

### If Push Fails
If you get an error about LFS, ensure Git LFS is properly set up:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.h5"
git lfs track "*.mp4"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Update LFS tracking"
git push -u origin main
```
