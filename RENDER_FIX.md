# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue
Render was deploying an old commit (a07f825) that didn't have gunicorn in requirements.txt.

## Solution Applied
✅ Pushed latest commits to GitHub with gunicorn included

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Trigger Manual Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
4. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Wait for Auto-Deploy
Render should automatically detect the new commits and redeploy within a few minutes.

### Option 3: Clear Build Cache
If still having issues:
1. Go to service **Settings**
2. Scroll to **"Build & Deploy"**
3. Click **"Clear build cache"**
4. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**

## Verify Deployment

Once deployed, check the logs for:
```
✅ Gemini AI models configured successfully
✅ Local disease detection model loaded
✅ Weather API configured successfully
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

## Latest Commit Includes

- ✅ gunicorn==21.2.0 in requirements.txt
- ✅ Procfile with correct start command
- ✅ runtime.txt with Python 3.11.0
- ✅ render.yaml configuration
- ✅ Database files
- ✅ All necessary dependencies

## Environment Variables to Set

Make sure these are set in Render:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key |
| `WEATHERAPI_KEY` | Your Weather API key |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `False` |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |

## Expected Build Output

You should see:
```
✅ Installing gunicorn==21.2.0
✅ Successfully installed gunicorn-21.2.0
✅ Build successful
✅ Running 'gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2 --timeout 120'
```

## If Still Failing

Check the build logs for:
1. All dependencies installed successfully
2. Gunicorn is in the installed packages list
3. No version conflicts

## Success Indicators

✅ Build completes without errors
✅ Gunicorn starts successfully
✅ App responds on assigned port
✅ Health check passes
✅ Service shows "Live" status

**Status**: Fixed and pushed to GitHub
**Action Required**: Trigger manual deploy on Render
